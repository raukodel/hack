Linux Structure
	- /	The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.
	- /bin	Contains essential command binaries.
	- /boot	Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
	- /dev	Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
	- /etc	Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
	- /home	Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
	- /lib	Shared library files that are required for system boot.
	- /media	External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
	- /mnt	Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
	- /opt	Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.
	- /root	The home directory for the root user.
	- /sbin	This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).
	- /tmp	The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.
	- /usr	Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.
	- /var	This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.

Shortcuts
	Auto-Complete

	Cursor Movement
	[CTRL] + A - Move the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

	[CTRL] + E - Move the cursor to the end of the current line.

The process will be killed without asking us for confirmation.
